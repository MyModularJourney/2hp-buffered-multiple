# 2hp-buffered-multiple

1-3 buffered multiple in 2hp Eurorack format. Nothing fancy, but functional.
Always handy to have close by to distribute signals throughout your modular.

I am currently creating a bill of materials and build guide. If you order the PCB at JLCPCB before this is complete, no issue. All the component values are listed on the PCB.
